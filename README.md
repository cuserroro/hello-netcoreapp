hello-netcoreapp
================

hello-netcoreapp is a basic *.NET Core* console application that prints "Hello World!". This repository contains additional scripts and files for building the app and creating release artifacts for a *framework-dependent deployment* (FDD), *self-contained deployment* (SCD), *Docker image*, *Chocolatey package* and *AppImage*.

This repository is meant to be a starting point for any new .NET Core console application. You can fork it and base your project upon it. If you improve anything in your fork, please create a PR â˜º . [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) 

The basic app was created using `dotnet new console` with the .NET Core SDK 2.0 and then extended for our purposes.

Terminology
-----------

- > *FDD* - Framework-dependent deployment:

    The app relies on an installed version of either the cross-platform *.NET Core* runtime or the Windows-only full .NET Framework. But it's completely portable to all operating systems where the runtime is installed.
- > *SCD* - Self-contained deployment:

    The app is completely *self-contained*. .NET Core runtime files are delivered with the executable, making this package slightly bigger than an FDD. It's independent of an installed .NET Core runtime, but not portable, so multiple SCDs must be created and each one only runs on a family of operating systems.
- > *Docker image*:

    The app can be run as Docker container (Linux and Windows), which is based on the official [Microsoft/dotnet Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/), using the image for FDDs that Microsoft recommends for use in production.
- > *Chocolatey package*:

    Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows, allowing you to install apps with one CLI command. Its package format is very similar to NuGet's. See [https://chocolatey.org/](https://chocolatey.org/) for details.
- > *AppImage*:

    AppImage is a new packaging format that allows you to execute an app on most Linux distributions without having to install any runtimes, dependencies or the app itself. It's portable, can optionally be integrated into the OS (MIME type registration, inclusion in start menu, ...) and optionally run in a sandbox like [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail). See [http://appimage.org/](http://appimage.org/) for details.

Build
-----

### Via cloud service

#### AppVeyor

This repository contains `.appveyor.yml`, which is a configuration file for the CI / CD cloud service [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp).

It's configured to do the following:

1. Run the build script `build.ps1`, which produces `*.zip` archives for FDD and SCD, as well as a Chocolatey package
2. If a *Git tag* was pushed:
    - Deploy all artifacts to [this repository's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp/releases)
        > Note: If the release already exists, existing files get overwritten (not all, only those where a new file was built, keeping files from the Travis CI build in case it finished first)
    
    - Deploy the Chocolatey package to [this app's MyGet feed](https://www.myget.org/gallery/hello-netcoreapp)

#### Travis CI

This repository contains `.travis.yml`, which is a configuration file for the CI / CD cloud service [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp).

It's configured to do the following:

1. Run the build script `build.sh`, which produces `*.tar.gz` archives for FDD and SCD, as well as an AppImage
2. If a *Git tag* was pushed:
    - Deploy all artifacts to [this repository's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp/releases)
        > Note: If the release already exists, existing files get overwritten (not all, only those where a new file was built, keeping files from the AppVeyor build in case it finished first)

#### Docker Cloud

The Docker image for Linux containers gets automatically build by Docker Cloud and pushed to the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp/). This is because Docker Hub itself doesn't support multi-stage builds as of now (2017-07-08).

### Locally

You can create the *FDD*, *SCD*, *Docker image*, *Chocolatey package* and *AppImage* locally as well.

- For building the FDDs and SCDs you need to have *either* the .NET Core SDK *or* Docker installed
    - Building the FDDs for .NET Framework 4.5.1 and 4.6.1 requires Windows
- For building the Docker image you need to have Docker installed
- For building the Chocolatey package you need to *either* use Windows and have Chocolatey installed *or* have Docker installed
- For building the AppImage you need to *either* use Linux *or* have Docker installed

#### FDD + SCD + Chocolatey package + AppImage

##### Build all artifacts

Depending on your OS and installed software, run the following scripts:

System | Installed | Run | Artifacts
-------|-----------|-----|----------
Windows | .NET Core SDK | `build.ps1` | <ul><li>FDDs, e.g. `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0.zip`</li><li>SCDs, e.g. `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.zip`</li><li>Chocolatey packages (if installed), e.g.: `hello-netcoreapp.0.1.0.nupkg`</li></ul>
Windows | Docker | `build-with-docker.ps1` | <ul><li>FDD: `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0.tar.gz`</li><li>SCDs, e.g. `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.tar.gz`</li><li>Chocolatey packages, e.g.: `hello-netcoreapp.0.1.0.nupkg`</li><li>AppImage: `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.AppImage`</li></ul>
Linux | .NET Core SDK | `build.sh` | <ul><li>FDD: `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0.tar.gz`</li><li>SCDs, e.g. `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.tar.gz`</li><li>AppImage: `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.AppImage`</li></ul>
Linux | Docker | `build-with-docker.sh` | <ul><li>FDD: `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0.tar.gz`</li><li>SCDs, e.g. `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.tar.gz`</li><li>Chocolatey packages, e.g.: `hello-netcoreapp.0.1.0.nupkg`</li><li>AppImage: `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.AppImage`</li></ul>

The SCDs that are built depend on the runtime identifiers in the `*.csproj`. To add or remove SCDs, just edit that file accordingly (see [available runtime identifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/rid-catalog)).

> Note: When running the `build-with-docker.ps1` script, the `build.sh` script will be executed inside of a Docker container. This script requires some files to have LF as line ending instead of CRLF. Commiting files with CRLF endings won't help - check your Git configuration `core.autocrlf` instead.

##### Build one artifact

To build just one artifact, you can pass the necessary arguments to the script, like so:
- `.\scripts\build.ps1 -publishType "fdd" -frameworkOrRuntime "netcoreapp2.0"`
- `.\scripts\build-with-docker.ps1 -publishType "scd" -frameworkOrRuntime "linux-x64"`
- `./scripts/build.sh "fdd" "netcoreapp2.0"`
- `./scripts/build-with-docker.sh "scd" "linux-x64"`

The same restrictions apply as when building all artifacts with calling the build script without arguments, so the AppImage and Chocolatey packages aren't built in all cases.

#### Docker image

> Note: When building the Linux container image in Windows, the `build.sh` script will be executed inside of the Docker builder container. This script requires some files to have LF as line ending instead of CRLF. Commiting files with CRLF endings won't help - check your Git configuration `core.autocrlf` instead.

In the root directory of the repository, depending on which container host system you want to target:

- For Linux containers, run: `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t local/hello-netcoreapp .`
    - Works on both Linux and Windows
- For Windows containers, run: `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.nano -t local/hello-netcoreapp:nanoserver .`
    - Only works on Windows

> Note: You don't need to create a Windows container image for using Docker in Windows. Linux containers work just fine on Windows. Creating a Windows container image is specifically for actual *Windows containers*, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/).

Run
---

You can run the console app either as *FDD*, *SCD*, *Docker container*, *Chocolatey package* or *AppImage*.

All artifacts are available for download from [this repository's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp/releases). The Chocolatey package is also available on [this app's MyGet feed](https://www.myget.org/gallery/hello-netcoreapp).

Alternatively you can build the artifacts on your own (see the *Build* section in this README).

### FDD

Depending on the operating system you use when building, there are multiple FDDs:
- hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0 (when built on Windows and Linux)
- hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_net451 (when built on Windows)
- hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_net461 (when built on Windows)

> Note: For running `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0` you need to have the .NET Core runtime installed. The other FDDs are for Windows only and do *not* require any runtime being installed. Windows already comes with the full .NET Framework, so those FDDs work out of the box. Use the `net461` version for up-to-date Windows systems and the `net451` one for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

You can copy the archive (`hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0.zip` or `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_netcoreapp2.0.tar.gz`) to wherever you want to run the app, extract the archive and run:

- `dotnet path/to/hello-netcoreapp.dll`

### SCD

> Note: Depending on your system you might need to install the dependencies listed here:
> - [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x#net-core-dependencies)
> - [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x#linux-distribution-dependencies) (For example for Ubuntu that's: `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libunwind8 libunwind8-dev gettext libicu-dev liblttng-ust-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev unzip`)
> - [macOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/macos-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x)

Copy the archive (for example `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.zip` or `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.tar.gz`) to wherever you want to run the app (only the OS has to match), extract the archive and run:

- Linux: `path/to/hello-netcoreapp`
- Windows: `path/to/hello-netcoreapp.exe`

### Docker container

- The simplest way is to create the Docker container from the Docker image on Docker Hub:
    - `docker run cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp`
        > Note: This currently only works for Linux containers (on either Linux or Windows)
- Alternatively you can build the image locally (see the *Build* section in this README) and then create a container from the image in the local image cache:
    - For the Linux container: `docker run local/hello-netcoreapp`
        - Works on both Linux and Windows
    - For the Windows container: `docker run local/hello-netcoreapp:nanoserver`
        - Only works on Windows

### Chocolatey package

> Note 1: You can only install and run Chocolatey packages on Windows!

> Note 2: Depending on your system you might need to install `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3`, as mentioned in the documentation about the [.NET Core prerequisites for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x#net-core-dependencies)

First you need to install the package with one of the following ways:

- The simplest way to install it is via the MyGet feed, which also allows you to easily update the app later:
    - `choco install hello-netcoreapp --source https://www.myget.org/F/hello-netcoreapp`
- AppVeyor also automatically publishes all `*.nupkg` artifacts to a project's NuGet feed, so this works as well:
    - `choco install hello-netcoreapp --source https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/hello-netcoreapp`
- Alternatively install the downloaded or locally built package:
    - `choco install path\to\hello-netcoreapp.portable.0.1.0.nupkg`
    - (Simply installing the [meta package](https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-faqs#what-is-the-difference-between-packages-no-suffix-as-compared-to-install-portable) `hello-netcoreapp.0.1.0.nupkg` works if the `portable` package exists in the same directory)
- Alternatively you can also install via the package specification file in this repository:
    1. Either run `build.ps1` or manually place `artifacts\hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_win-x64` in `chocolatey\tools`
    2. `choco install chocolatey\hello-netcoreapp.nuspec`

Then run: `hello-netcoreapp`

> Note: The package is installed in `%ChocolateyInstall%/lib` (e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Chocolatey\lib`)

### AppImage

> Note 1: You can only use AppImages on Linux and you must *either* have fuse installed *or* mount or extract the AppImage, see [AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE)

> Note 2: Depending on your system you might need to install the dependencies listed in the documentation about the [.NET Core prerequisites for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x#linux-distribution-dependencies). For example for Ubuntu that's:
> 
> - `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libunwind8 libunwind8-dev gettext libicu-dev liblttng-ust-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev unzip`

After downloading the AppImage, you have to make it executable: `chmod u+x hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.AppImage`

Then run: `hello-netcoreapp_v0.1.0_linux-x64.AppImage`

For integrating the AppImage into your OS (MIME type registration, start menu), you can run the optional AppImage daemon. Read more about it here: [https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/blob/appimagetool/master/README.md#appimaged-usage](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/blob/appimagetool/master/README.md#appimaged-usage)

Simplify running the app
------------------------

> Note: This is not necessary if you installed the app with Chocolatey.

The app is portable, meaning the FDD or SCD can reside anywhere on your system (for example in `$env:USERPROFILE\MyPortableApps\hello-netcoreapp` on Windows or `$HOME/myPortableApps/hello-netcoreapp` on Linux), and Docker containers can be run anywhere anyway.

Now you should do the following, so you don't have to enter the full path of the executable (for FDD / SCD) or full docker command when you want to run the app:

- On Windows: Create a function (like an alias, but supports passing arguments) for the app for PowerShell:
    1. Edit the file returned by `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts` and add:
        - For FDD: `function hello-netcoreapp { dotnet $env:USERPROFILE\MyPortableApps\hello-netcoreapp\hello-netcoreapp.dll $args }`
        - For SCD: `function hello-netcoreapp { $env:USERPROFILE\MyPortableApps\hello-netcoreapp\hello-netcoreapp.exe $args }`
        - For Docker: `function hello-netcoreapp { docker run --rm local/hello-netcoreapp $args }`
    1. Source your Profile so that the alias becomes available immediately: `. $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts`
- On Linux: Create a function (like an alias, but supports passing arguments) for the app for Bash:
    1. Edit `~/.bashrc` and add:
        - For FDD: `function hello-netcoreapp() { dotnet $HOME/myPortableApps/hello-netcoreapp/hello-netcoreapp.dll $@; }`
        - For SCD: `function hello-netcoreapp() { $HOME/myPortableApps/hello-netcoreapp/hello-netcoreapp $@; }`
        - For Docker: `function hello-netcoreapp() { docker run --rm cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp $@; }`
    1. Source your bashrc so that the alias becomes available immediately: `source ~/.bashrc`
- Linux alternative for SCD: Create a symbolic link in a directory that's already in the PATH:
    - `ln -s $HOME/myPortableApps/hello-netcoreapp/hello-netcoreapp /usr/local/bin/hello-netcoreapp`

Now you can run the following command on any OS and from any directory (and also pass arguments):

- `hello-netcoreapp`

> Note: You shouldn't add the whole app directory to the PATH, because the directory contains many files and in some cases this leads to tab auto-completion for files like `hello-netcoreapp.deps.json`.

Uninstall
---------

- FDD:
    1. Delete the directory that contains the `hello-netcoreapp.dll`
    2. Remove the function from your PowerShell profile / `~/.bashrc` in case you set it
- SCD:
    1. Delete the directory that contains the `hello-netcoreapp.exe` (Windows) / `hello-netcoreapp` (Linux)
    2. Remove the function from your PowerShell profile / `~/.bashrc` in case you set it
- Docker image:
    1. Delete the container: `docker container rm <id>`
    2. Delete the image: `docker image rm cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp`
    3. Remove the function from your PowerShell profile / `~/.bashrc` in case you set it
- Chocolatey package:
    - If you installed the [meta package](https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-faqs#what-is-the-difference-between-packages-no-suffix-as-compared-to-install-portable): `choco uninstall hello-netcoreapp`
    - Otherwise: `choco uninstall hello-netcoreapp.portable`
- AppImage:
    - Just delete the `*.AppImage` file
