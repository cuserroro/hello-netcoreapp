This is an open source project that I maintain in my free time. I can only offer limited support, but will do my best to fix any bugs and implement new feature requests.

Before filing a bug or feature request, please check if a related issue already exists [here](https://github.com/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp/issues).

To file a bug or feature request, just create an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/cuserroro/hello-netcoreapp/issues/new).
