# How to contribute to hello-netcoreapp

Found a bug in our code, or have an idea for a feature? Here are some notes on how to best report them so we can get it fixed as quickly as possible.

## Security Issues

***Any security issues should be submitted directly to <roberto.reff@poligram.com>***

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

1. Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to? 
2. Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at <roberto.reff@poligram.com>.

## Other Issues

Found a bug in hello-netcoreapp? Here are some notes on how to report the bug so we can fix it as fast as possible:

- Explain, as detailed as possible, how to reproduce the issue.
- Include what you expected to happen, as well as what actually happened.
- If it's a bug with the website, please include information on what browser version and operating system you are running.
- If it helps, feel free to [attach a screenshot](https://github.com/blog/1347-issue-attachments) or video illustrating the issue.
- Include all this information in a new issue on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/philippgille/hello-netcoreapp/issues)

## Pull Requests

Know how to fix something? We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1. [Check for open issues](https://github.com/philippgille/hello-netcoreapp/issues), or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.  
   Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request.
2. Fork the relevant repository on GitHub, and start making your changes.
3. Check out the README for the project for information specific to that repository.
3. Push the change (we recommend using a separate branch for your feature).
4. Open a pull request.
5. We try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from us after a couple of days, feel free to leave a comment on the pull request.
